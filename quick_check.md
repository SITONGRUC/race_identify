| Study Context | Primary Data | Algorithms Used | The "Inference Problem" (Key Errors) | The "Fix" (Mitigation Strategy) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Venture Funding | LinkedIn Photos | DeepFace + Name Embeddings | Skin-tone analysis misclassified South Asians as Black and light-skinned Black founders as White. | 100% manual review of 150k photos; checked "secondary signals" (HBCUs, affinity groups). |
| Voter/Tax Disparities | Census Surnames + Location | BIRDIE (Bayesian Model) | Standard surname (BISG) weighting massively underestimates racial gaps (e.g., calculated 16% gap vs. true 54% gap). | Used surnames as an Instrumental Variable conditioned on outcomes to update probabilities. |
| Fair Lending (PPP) | Loan Apps + LinkedIn | DeepFace vs. BISG | BISG (names) had low correlation (0.54) for Black applicants; produced more errors than correct ID. | Switched to image analysis (0.87 correlation); used specific name filters to remove South Asians. |
| Children's Books | Illustrations | AutoML Vision + Custom CNN | Standard models trained on photos fail to recognize or classify drawn/illustrated faces. | Created custom training set (Illus Face 1.0) of 5,403 hand-labeled illustrations. |
| Job Market (LinkedOut) | LinkedIn Profiles | Predictrace (Names) + StyleGAN2 | Found DeepFace "less reliable than anticipated" for profile pictures in their specific sample. | Abandoned image inference for name-based inference; used human validation for AI-generated faces. |
| Corporate Workforce | LinkedIn Profiles | DeepFace (Images) + rethnicity (Names) | Images are reliable for Black ID but fail for Hispanic ID. Names are reliable for Hispanic ID but fail for Black ID. | Hybrid hierarchy: use pictures for Black ID, but switch to names for Hispanic ID (and vice versa based on confidence scores). |
| Sharing Economy (Airbnb) | Profile Photos | Face++ + Humans (MTurk) | Automated tools often yielded low confidence scores or failed on ambiguous photos. | "Tie-breaker" human review: used 3 humans per photo; manual override by authors if humans disagreed. |
